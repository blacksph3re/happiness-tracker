# Happiness Tracker

Backend lives in `backend/` — FastAPI, managed with `uv`, SQLAlchemy ORM over SQLite,
Alembic for migrations. Run commands from `backend/` via `uv run ...`.

Frontend lives in `app/` — Svelte 5 SPA on Vite, managed with `pnpm` (there is no `npm`
on this machine). `pnpm build` emits into `backend/static`, which FastAPI mounts and
serves with an `index.html` fallback, so the whole thing ships as one server process.
API routes must be registered before that mount and should live under `/api`.

## Styling

Tailwind CSS v4 with Flowbite as the component layer, wired up in `app/src/app.css`
(there is no `tailwind.config.js` — v4 is configured in CSS).

The app defines its own palette in the `@theme` block of `app/src/app.css` and styles
against **those** tokens, not Flowbite's `bg-brand` family: `bg-ink`, `bg-ink-soft`,
`text-paper`, `text-haze`, `bg-dusk`, `hover:bg-dusk-lift`, `border-ember`. Two
utility classes carry the type treatment — `.meta` for labels and metadata, `.numeral`
for anything tabular. Add a token to `@theme` rather than reaching for a raw palette
step like `bg-indigo-600`.

Flowbite v4 dropped the `primary-*` scale used by earlier versions, and a class that
names a token which does not exist produces **no CSS at all** rather than an error —
`bg-primary-700` is silently invisible. After adding a class built on a new token,
confirm it appears in the built stylesheet under `backend/static/assets/`.

Flowbite's interactive behaviour comes from importing `flowbite` in `src/main.js`. It
initialises on load; components rendered later need an explicit `initFlowbite()`.

## Docstrings

**Python only.** Every class, method, property, and function outside of tests must
carry a [numpy-style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
docstring. This applies to new code and to any existing code you touch.

JavaScript, Svelte and CSS do not need blanket documentation. Comment the parts that
are not obvious from reading them — a workaround, a non-local invariant, a reason
something is done the slow way — and leave the self-evident alone.

- Start with a one-line summary in the imperative mood, then an optional free-form
  description after a blank line.
- Document arguments under `Parameters`, results under `Returns` (or `Yields` for
  generators), and raised exceptions under `Raises`. Omit a section when it does not
  apply — a summary line alone is sufficient for a function that takes and returns
  nothing meaningful.
- Do not document `self` or `cls`.
- Never use a class-level `Attributes` section. Document each attribute with its own
  docstring on the line directly below its declaration, so the description sits next to
  the definition it describes. The class docstring stays a short summary of the whole.
- Test functions are exempt; give them descriptive names instead.

Attribute example:

```python
class User(Base):
    """A person who records happiness entries."""

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    """Surrogate primary key."""

    email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), unique=True, index=True)
    """Unique, indexed address identifying the user."""
```

Function example:

```python
def score_entry(rating: int, weight: float = 1.0) -> float:
    """Scale a raw happiness rating by its weight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rating : int
        Raw rating on a 1-10 scale.
    weight : float, optional
        Multiplier applied to the rating, by default 1.0.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The weighted score.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `rating` falls outside the 1-10 range.
    """
```
